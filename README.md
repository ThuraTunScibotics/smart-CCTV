## Introduction
Normally, most cases of CCTV just record all times situations and store video data into storage-drive or actively watching by human. As CCTV is used to watch or check unormal and dangerous activities happening in the places like shops, supermarkets or locations that stored precious goods, so it is better to know the situations immediately if unnormal or illegal activities are happening. For the case like a group of thives try to enter and steal things from a shop during midnignt when nobody is at the shop. At this time, something changes and movements of them will appear in front of CCTV's view. If CCTV is the purpose for just recording and storing data for checking later, it would be less probability for catching the illegal group as fast as possible. In this case, it would be great there is a software in CCTV that can detect something changes and activites happening in camera's view, and sending allert to someone authority or owner. 
In this project, we will record those specific changes or activities and just storing the video clip with changes or activities into storage-media for saving much storage space. Whenever the changes are happen, we just store the frame with object detection of that significant changes, and this make our CCTV more smarter. We can also send this video clip to owner or autority as CCTV alert-system. You can see the two situations of normal condition and significant unnormal activities happened in the shop by seeing the following images.
